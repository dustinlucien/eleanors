<p><b>Privacy &amp; Security</b>
</p>
<p>We take seriously the issue of safeguarding the privacy of information. We have created this Privacy Policy in order to better familiarize you with the information we collect or obtain, and the way in which we use this information to better operate our business and serve the needs of our guests.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What is Personal Information?</b></p>
<p>The term “Personal Information” refers to any information that can be used to identify you as an individual or is about you as an individual. It can include, among other things, your name, address, age, gender and personal financial history.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How is Personal Information Collected?</b></p>
<p>While in the process of browsing our website, you also provide us with information that does not reveal your personal identity—what type of product you're seeking information about, for example. We use this aggregated, anonymous data mainly for website improvements, but we do not connect it to any Personal Information, such as your name or address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While you explore our website for the information that interests you, you may wish use the “Contact Request” form to inquire about one of our categories or products, or you may wish to participate in one of our online surveys or promotions. To respond to this request or to participate in our various programs, we may ask you for Personal Information, such as your name, zip code, email address and phone number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event you choose to provide us with this information, we will use it for the purpose solicited as well as to enhance our ability to provide services to you. We will only email you where and when it is appropriate, and you can choose a number of alternate methods by which to receive a reply to a request. Your use and navigation of our website shall constitute your acknowledgment to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy generally, and your transmittal or provision of Personal Information shall constitute your acknowledgment of and agreement to the terms and conditions contained in this Privacy Policy with regard to Personal Information. If you are uncomfortable providing this information, you can always call us.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish, you may also submit your email address in order to be placed on a subscription list or to receive other information. You will be placed on these lists only when you indicate your desire to be included. In deciding whether or not to join such lists, please note that they are only used for internal purposes; we do not sell or rent our lists to anyone. In the event you choose to join one of our lists, you may ask to be removed from the list at any time as it is our desire to allow each visitor to have the ability to accept or decline any form of communication from us.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How Do We Store Information?</b></p>
<p>We regularly obtain and store information in both digital and physical form. In order to better facilitate the security for Personal Information, we endeavor to store Personal Information in a secure location, be it a database or filing cabinet. Furthermore, we take steps to limit and control access to this information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Primarily, the information stored on our customer database systems includes what is needed in order to facilitate the provision of our services and to improve the efficiency of your visit. Customer name, address, phone numbers recorded and made available as needed when you complete a transaction. &nbsp;We never store your credit card information ourselves, but rely on third-party shopping card vendors and payment processors that are PCI compliant in order to handle that sensitive information.</p>
<p>It is important to note that there is always risk associated with disclosing any information and in particular with regard to method of disclosure used. For example, email communication can not be guaranteed as secure, so there is a risk inherent in the use of email. Please be aware of this when requesting information or sending forms to us by email (for example, from the Contact Us section of our website). We recommend that you do not include any confidential information (e.g., credit card information) when using email. For your protection, our email responses to you will not include any confidential information.&nbsp;</p>
